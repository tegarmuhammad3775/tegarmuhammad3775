# About Me 🌳 
Hello! I’m Tegar Muhammad Soekarno, a software engineer turned Quality Assurance (QA) enthusiast with a rich background in software development and a newfound passion for driving software excellence through meticulous testing and quality control. With 4 years of experience in software engineering, I bring a developer’s perspective to the QA field, understanding the intricacies of software creation and the critical importance of delivering error-free, user-centric products.

My journey in the tech industry began as a software engineer, where I was deeply involved in designing, coding, and implementing software solutions. Over time, my interest gradually shifted towards the quality aspects of software development. I found myself more intrigued by the challenge of not just creating software but ensuring it meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.

Eager to fully embrace my role in QA, I am actively enhancing my knowledge in automated testing tools, QA methodologies, certifications, etc. My goal is to bridge my software engineering expertise with new QA skills to contribute effectively to quality assurance processes and ultimately enhance product quality.
